{"name":"Broshuntfloodlight","tagline":"active connection shunting based on floodlight openflow ","body":"broShuntingFramework\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThe shunting framework uses a series of state transitions to define the behavior.  The various tranition states are:\r\n\r\n  CutoffTime : Connections are analyzed for an observation period.  When that period expires \r\n      without adequate data being moved, then the session object is set to 'CutoffTime' and \r\n      the state removed.\r\n  \r\n  FlowTrackInit : A \"FlowTrack\" in this case is a pair of address' .  When a unique pair of \r\n      addresses is identified, the session state is set to FlowTrackInit to identify this.\r\n  \r\n  FlowTrackRemove : Like the Init above, when the last connection associated with an address \r\n      pair is closed, then the FlowTrack table entry is removed as well.\r\n  \r\n  RemoveConnection : If a connection no longer exists after the test_connection() function is \r\n      called, the state is set to RemoveConnection and the data is cleared via clear_shunt(c).\r\n  \r\n  ShuntClear : Something like the initial garbage collection call, this state signifies the start\r\n      of the closing sequence called by flow_tracker_remove(c) .  \r\n  \r\n  ShuntFlowInit : When a connection is first seen at the connection_established event, the state is set\r\n      to ShuntFlowInit and basic values are defined for the additonal connection structure.\r\n\r\n  ShuntFlowIPIgnore : When flow_tracker_add(c) >= shunt_track_high_water the state is set to this to\r\n      identify that the connection is being shunted via the more complete IP <-> IP filter.\r\n\r\n  ShuntTrackerHighWater :  When ++shunt_tracker[oA,rA] == shunt_track_high_water and *this connection* pushes the \r\n      FlowTrack monitor over the threshold, then it's state will be set to ShuntTrackerHighWater.\r\n\r\n  ShuntTrackerIncrement : This connection has incremented the pre-existing FlowTrack value. \r\n\r\n  ShuntTrackerLWater :  Likewise when --shunt_tracker[oA,rA] == shunt_track_low_water, this will get a connection\r\n      state set to ShuntTrackerLWater.\r\n\r\n  ShuntTrigger : A connection has exceeded the data volume requirements for shunting.\r\n\r\n  TestConnection : This is more of a place holder in that the connection is still in testing.  There is \r\n      no reason for this to show up in the logs since it is consitered \"normal\".\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
